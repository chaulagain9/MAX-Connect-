For the evaluation function I have used the findBestPlay function which find the optimal play for the AI(Computer) to play against the human.
For this findBestPlay function , it takes a column number as a parameter and plays it in the GameBoard following the alpha-beta pruning with depth limited search. Here we have the seven columns and and if the play is valid we create new object of GameBoard and play that piece and it follow the alpha beta pruning with minimax implementation.
The function beats the player who plays randomly without playing the optimal game.


Table of Depth limit and CPU runtime
